{"id":"tabletest-reporter-858","title":"Explore CSS class support for other documentation systems","description":"TableTest Reporter currently generates AsciiDoc and Markdown. AsciiDoc supports roles that become CSS classes. This issue investigates CSS class support for Markdown.\n\n## Research Findings (2026-01-22)\n\n### Standard Markdown (CommonMark/GFM)\n**No support** for CSS classes on table cells. GitHub, GitLab, and most basic renderers don't support any attribute syntax.\n\n### Python-Markdown (MkDocs)\n**Supported** via `attr_list` extension. Cell-level attributes work with this syntax:\n```markdown\n| content {.passed .expectation} |\n```\n\nRequirements:\n- Must enable `attr_list` extension in `mkdocs.yml`\n- Attributes must be at end of cell content\n- Must be separated by space from content\n- Works for both `\u003ctd\u003e` and `\u003cth\u003e` elements\n\nLimitation: Cannot set attributes on `\u003ctable\u003e`, `\u003cthead\u003e`, `\u003ctbody\u003e`, or `\u003ctr\u003e` elements.\n\nReference: [Python-Markdown attr_list docs](https://python-markdown.github.io/extensions/attr_list/)\n\n### Pandoc\n**Limited support**. Can add attributes to some block elements but not inline table cells. Workarounds exist using Div wrappers but don't apply to individual cells.\n\nReference: [Pandoc User's Guide](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html)\n\n### kramdown (Jekyll)\nHas `{:.class}` syntax but cell-level support is inconsistent.\n\n### markdown-it (JavaScript)\n**Supported** via [markdown-it-attrs](https://github.com/arve0/markdown-it-attrs) plugin with similar `{.class}` syntax.\n\n---\n\n## Implementation Feasibility\n\n**Feasible for Python-Markdown/MkDocs users** with template changes:\n\nCurrent `macros.md.peb` ignores roles:\n```pebble\n{% macro renderCell(cell) %}\n    {{- renderValue(cell.value) -}}\n{% endmacro %}\n```\n\nCould be extended to:\n```pebble\n{% macro renderCell(cell) %}\n    {{- renderValue(cell.value) -}}\n    {%- if cell.roles is not empty %} {.{% for role in cell.roles %}{{ role }}{% if not loop.last %} {% endif %}{% endfor %}}{% endif -%}\n{% endmacro %}\n```\n\nOutput example:\n```markdown\n| Small {.scenario .passed} | 1 {.passed} | 2 {.passed} | 3 {.expectation .passed} |\n```\n\n**Caveat**: This breaks rendering on processors without attribute support (GitHub, GitLab). Options:\n1. Add a config option to enable/disable role output in Markdown\n2. Create a separate `markdown-attrs` format\n3. Document as \"MkDocs-compatible Markdown\"\n\n---\n\n## Recommendation\n\n**P3 - Low priority**. The target audience for TableTest Reporter primarily uses:\n- AsciiDoc (fully supported)\n- Plain Markdown for simple docs (roles not critical)\n\nIf users request MkDocs support specifically, implement as:\n1. New format `markdown-mkdocs` or config option `markdown.attributes=true`\n2. Update `macros.md.peb` to conditionally output `{.class}` syntax\n3.

Documentation update section in CLAUDE.md focuses mainly on features\n2. Not clear that bug fixes also need CHANGELOG.md updates\n3. Section is buried in middle of workflow steps\n4. No automated reminder when source files change\n\n## Proposed Improvements\n\n### 1. Restructure CLAUDE.md Documentation Section\n- Rename \"Documentation Updates for Features\" → \"Documentation Updates\"\n- Clarify that ALL user-facing changes need documentation:\n  - New features → CHANGELOG.md (Added) + README.md\n  - Bug fixes → CHANGELOG.md (Fixed)\n  - Breaking changes → CHANGELOG.md (Changed) + README.md\n  - Internal refactorings → No documentation needed\n- Make section more prominent in workflow steps\n- Add examples of what counts as \"user-facing\"\n\n### 2. Add Pre-commit Hook Reminder\nAdd check in `git-hooks/pre-commit` that warns (doesn't block) when:\n- Files in `tabletest-reporter-*/src/main/` are changed\n- But `CHANGELOG.md` is NOT staged\n\nExample implementation:\n```bash\n# Check if documentation should be updated\nif git diff --cached --name-only | grep -q 'tabletest-reporter-.*/src/main/'; then\n    if \\! git diff --cached --name-only | grep -q 'CHANGELOG.md'; then\n        echo \"\"\n        echo \"⚠️  Note: Source files changed but CHANGELOG.md not updated\"\n        echo \"   Consider updating CHANGELOG.md if this affects users\"\n        echo \"   (Bug fixes, new features, breaking changes need documentation)\"\n        echo \"\"\n    fi\nfi\n```\n\n### 3. Hook Behavior\n- Warning only, not blocking (allow internal refactorings)\n- Only trigger for `src/main/` changes (not test files)\n- Remind about both CHANGELOG.md and README.md (for major features)\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] CLAUDE.md section restructured and clarified\n- [ ] Pre-commit hook includes documentation reminder\n- [ ] Hook triggers for src/main changes\n- [ ] Hook is non-blocking (warning only)\n- [ ] Examples added for what needs documentation\n\n## Related\n- Recent example: tabletest-reporter-wn4 (bug fix) - forgot to update CHANGELOG.md initially","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","owner":"nch@scienta.no","created_at":"2026-01-21T18:11:04.138525+01:00","created_by":"Nils Christian Haugen","updated_at":"2026-01-21T18:11:04.138525+01:00"}

{"id":"tabletest-reporter-c5t","title":"Auto-detect junit.platform.reporting.output.dir","description":"## Context\n\nThe `InputDirectoryResolver` needs to auto-detect the JUnit property `junit.platform.reporting.output.dir` to find where JUnit wrote test output YAML files. The challenge is that the reporter runs at report-generation time (separate JVM from test execution), so the property value from the test run is not directly available.\n\n## Current State\n\n- `System.getProperty()` fallback in the resolver is effectively dead code at report time\n- Only the Gradle plugin passes the value explicitly via `junitOutputDirOverride`\n- Maven plugin and CLI always pass `null`\n- Convention fallbacks (`target/junit-jupiter`, `build/junit-jupiter`) cover common defaults\n\n## Key Findings\n\n### JUnit 5 vs 6 directory structure\n- **JUnit 5**: Writes directly into configured output dir\n- **JUnit 6**: Prepends engine ID as subdirectory (e.g. `build/` → `build/junit-jupiter/`)\n- The `junit-jupiter` name is the engine ID; other engines use different names\n\n### {uniqueNumber} placeholder\n- Config like `reports/junit-{uniqueNumber}` creates `reports/junit-8803697269315188212`\n- With JUnit 6 engine ID: `reports/junit-8803697269315188212/junit-jupiter/`\n- Parallel forks create multiple such directories simultaneously\n\n### Configuration methods in practice\n- Gradle: `systemProperty()` or `jvmArgumentProviders` in `tasks.test`\n- Maven Surefire: Internal convention (`target/junit-jupiter`), or `configurationParameters`\n- `junit-platform.properties`: Standard JUnit mechanism but rarely used (0/6 compat tests)\n\n## Proposed Strategy (Three Tiers)\n\n### Tier 1: Remove dead code\nRemove `System.getProperty()` from `resolveJunitOutputDir`. The `junitOutputDirOverride` parameter already covers explicit passing.\n\n### Tier 2: Read `junit-platform.properties`\n- Read `src/test/resources/junit-platform.properties` relative to `baseDir`\n- Extract `junit.platform.reporting.output.dir` if present\n- If value contains `{uniqueNumber}`, don't try to resolve it — fall back to convention scanning\n- Consider a separate `JunitPropertiesReader` class for testability\n\n### Tier 3: Leave complex cases to the user\nThese are too complex for reliable auto-detection:\n- `{uniqueNumber}` directories from parallel forks\n- Non-standard engine IDs\n- Custom `OutputDirectoryCreator` implementations\n- IDE-specific output directories\n\n### Resolution order after implementation\n1. Explicit input directory (user-configured) → CONFIGURED\n2.

Do common documentation publishing systems (GitHub Pages, GitLab Pages, ReadTheDocs, Netlify) benefit from or require indexify pattern?\n2.
